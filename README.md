Sure! Since the link you shared (`http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`) is a **local development URL**, I can’t access your actual project files — but I can still create a **professional README.md** template for your website project.

Please confirm what your project is (e.g., *portfolio website*, *landing page*, *AI project*, *internship task*, etc.).
For now, here’s a **generic professional README.md** for a personal web project — you can edit the placeholders as needed 👇

If you tell me **what the project actually is** (for example, “Stopwatch Web App”, “Landing Page”, “Portfolio”, or “Internship Task 3”), I’ll make a **customized README.md** for that exact project — with the right title, description, and tech stack.  

Would you like me to tailor it for your **PRODIGY_WD_03** project (from your GitHub)?
